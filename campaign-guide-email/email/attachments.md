# Attachments

#### What do I need to know?

* images and files uploaded are directly stored and served in the Postman backend server.
* .png, .jpg, .jpeg, and .gif file types will be embedded as images in the email content by clicking the image icon.
* files embedded as download links can be in any format.
* the total size of all your attachments must be equal to or less than 50MB.

#### How do I upload attachments?

If you have any images and attachments that need to be sent in your email content, simply click on the paperclip icon, and upload your file (by dragging and dropping, or clicking to select your file).

You can choose to leave the file name as is, or rename it.

If you choose to rename your file, the link text will appear as what you renamed in the message template field.

### What if I want to send individualised files to my recipients?

If you would like to send personalised files to recipients, we would advise you to upload these files onto [go.gov.sg](https://go.gov.sg/#/) (for all public service officers except for those from healthcare institutions and schools) or [ForEduSG](https://for.edu.sg/#/) (for officers from schools) or [ForSG](https://for.sg/#/) (for officers from healthcare institutions). Then, include the GoGovSG links in your recipient list.
