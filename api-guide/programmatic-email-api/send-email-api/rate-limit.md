# Rate Limit

## How It Works

Our rate limit is applied on a per account (i.e. email address) basis. The default rate limit of our API is 10 emails per second. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429` error code.

## Need a Higher Rate Limit?

To increase this rate limit, please [contact us](https://go.gov.sg/postman-contact-us). If you provide more details on your email workload, we could work out a higher rate limit for you.
