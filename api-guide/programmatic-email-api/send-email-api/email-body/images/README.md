# Images

## Supported Image Formats

Our API supports embedding images within the body of your email using the following methods:

1. [Internet-linked images](internet-images.md) - this is the recommended, modern method for including images in your email.
2. [Content-ID images](./content-id-images.md) - this method is useful for embedding images that are not available on the Internet, such as images that are dynamically generated by your application.

## How About Base64-Encoded Images?

We do not officially support base64-encoded images for the following reasons:

- Popular web clients like Gmail do not support base64-encoded images.
- Emails with base64-encoded images are significantly larger, are more likely to be clipped by email clients (for more information, [see here](../README.md#size-limit)) take longer to send, and are more likely to be marked as spam.

If your use case requires dynamically generated images and you are unable to host your own images on the Internet, we recommend that you look into [Content-ID images](./content-id-images.md) as a replacement for base64-encoded images.

While we do not officially support base64-encoded images, we do not prevent you from sending them. If you choose to do so, please note that you have to stay within the [email size limit](../README.md#size-limit).
