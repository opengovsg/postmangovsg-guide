# ðŸ“¨ Programmatic GovSG WhatsApp API

We provide a **modern, cost-effective, and compliant PaaS** for to send programmatic emails.

## What are programmatic emails?

These are emails that are triggered by a computer system, typically as part of a larger workflow.

For example, consider an agency that receives grant applications from members of the public. When an applicant submits a grant on your website, upon receiving the submission, your system could call our API to send out an acknowledgement email. The same could be done for sending one-time-passwords (OTPs), appointment booking confirmations, status updates emails, and so on.

Our existing users include both external agencies, such as ICA, CPF, and MOM, as well as OGP products, such as [Health Appointment System](https://book.health.gov.sg/), [Isomer](https://www.isomer.gov.sg/), [CheckWho](https://checkwho.gov.sg/login), and [Care360](https://care360.health.gov.sg/login).

## Value proposition

Our product is built on top of the commercial cloud and thus is aligned with the Government's "Commercial Cloud First Policy" to unlock the benefits of the cloud, such as improved reliability, auto-scaling, and lower costs.

For Intranet users, our API is most similar to App Mail Relay (AMR). For more details:
