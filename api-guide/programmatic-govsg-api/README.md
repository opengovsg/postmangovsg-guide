## What are programmatic Gov.sg WhatsApp API

These are WhatsApp messages sent through our Gov.sg WhatsApp channel (Read more about it [here](broken-reference)).

As your agencies might have existing systems and workflows to reach out to members of public which requires a more customised solution compared to our Gov.sg campaign offering, integration with our programmatic Gov.sg WhatsApp API is the answer to that. You can send out messages based on the available templates on our platform depending on your needs.
