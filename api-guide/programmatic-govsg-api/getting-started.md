# Getting Started

### **Step 1: Request for access**

As Gov.sg WhatsApp channel is currently available on an invite-only basis, you have to send in a request via [this form](https://go.gov.sg/sgc-interest-form). Please also tell us about your use-case so we can make the appropriate templates available for your account.

Make sure that your account has been whitelisted for this channel before using it. An easy way to check this by logging into the [Postman platform](https://postman.gov.sg) and see if you can create a Gov.sg WhatsApp campaign.

### **Step 2: Generate API Key on Postman.gov.sg**

Log in to Postman.gov.sg using the whitelisted email address identified in **Step 1** and generate the API Key. This API key will be used to authenticate your requests. You may follow the steps outlined [here](../api-key-management/generate-your-api-key.md).

### **Step 3: Start sendng test messages and integration**

Retrieve ID of the message template that you need using [this endpoint](./get-templates-api.md) and send out test messages using [the sending endpoint](./send-message-api.md).

### **Step 4: Communicate go-live date to the Postman team**

If you have any feature requests or need additional support, please let us know with an expected go-live date.
