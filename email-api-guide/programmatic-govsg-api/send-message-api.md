## Overview

This endpoints accept a request body that contains information about the Gov.sg WhatsApp message to be sent. Each successful request to this endpoint will send out a single Gov.sg WhatsApp message.

{% swagger src="https://api.postman.gov.sg/openapi.yaml" path="/transactional/govsg/send" method="post" %}
[https://api.postman.gov.sg/openapi.yaml](https://api.postman.gov.sg/openapi.yaml)
{% endswagger %}

## Request Body

1.  `recipient`: Mobile phone number of the recipient without special formatting (only contains numerical characters and prefixed with plus sign if country code is included).

    **Notes**:

    * Country code will need to be provided for non-SG mobile numbers.
    * If country code is not provided, the phone number will be defaulted to be an SG number.
2. `template_id`: ID of the template that suits your need (can be retrieved from [GET templates endpoint](get-templates-api.md))
3. `params`: A key-value object with keys being the parameter names (wrapped in double curly braces in the template body) and corresponding string values to fill in the template body.
4. `language_code` (optional): The language code that can be retrieved from the `multilingual_support` field of the template

{% hint style="info" %}
For message status, we have 6 different states that a message can be in:

* `UNSENT` - Initial state of a newly created transactional Gov.sg message (this status is not returned in the course of a successful request to send a GovSG message)
* `ACCEPTED` - Message has been accepted by our service provider (this status is returned in the course of a successful request to send a Gov.sg message)
* `SENT` - The send request was successfully forwarded to our service provider and our service provider will attempt to deliver the message to the recipientâ€™s phone number (API user can check this and all subsequent statuses via the `/transactional/govSG/{messageId}` endpoint)
* `DELIVERED` - The service provider has successfully delivered the message to the recipient's phone number
* `READ` - The recipient has received the message and viewed it
* `ERROR` - An error happened when the service provider is trying to deliver the message
