# Step 3a: Receive Your Account Invitation

Once you have submitted this [form](https://form.gov.sg/646b1a06df92fa001262a17e), the Postman team will provision you with a Twilio account within _3 working days_. What this means is that you will receive an invitation to join a Twilio account in your email inbox. Click on the link `View invitation` to access your Twilio account when you receive the email. Then, set up your account details by following the instructions [here](step-3b-set-up-your-twilio-account.md).

Do note that the account name reflected in your account is _not_ your senderID and will not affect your SMS sending nor your senderID. It is a name assigned by Postman for identification purposes.
