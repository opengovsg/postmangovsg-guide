# Step 5: Send a Test Message

Note that this step is done in Twilio, not Postman, yet.

Navigate back to the console and under **Try it out**, select **Send an SMS.** Insert your own phone number and select the messaging service that you set up earlier in step 4.

Type your message and click send to check if you receive the SMS and if the SenderID is accurate.

**If you don't receive your test SMS**, it is likely that this SenderID has been taken by another agency. You should use another Alphanumeric Sender ID. Otherwise, reach out to us [here](../../contact-us.md) so that we can link you up with our Twilio account manager.
