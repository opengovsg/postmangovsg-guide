2. **Set up your account name.**

This helps us and Twilio better identify your account should you need help, without having to go into your account itself, which we prefer in order to respect the privacy and security of your account.

Go to `Account > General settings > Account details > Account name.`

3. **Set up your billing details.**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Information about Twilio billing**

Twilio works like a prepaid phone card. You will need to top up the credits in your Twilio account to start sending SMSes. We strongly recommend using your **corporate credit card** for this.

The alternative is direct invoicing, which is only available as an option if you send more than 25,000 SMSes a month (or meet the minimum spend of USD$12,000 annually). If this is your preferred option, please contact us so we can put you in touch with our Twilio account manager.

_Note: if you do not upgrade your account, you will not be able to send SMSes with your registered alphanumeric SenderID._

#### To set up your billing options, go to Billing > Manage Billing > Upgrade.
