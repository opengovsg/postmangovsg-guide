## Customising your Sender Details

You can customise the sender field when creating your campaign in step 1. The email will be received by recipients as ‚Äú_`Your agency name`_` `` ``via Postman `‚Äù, with the default sender email address for all Postman campaigns being `donotreply@mail.postman.gov.sg.`

You can also choose to send a copy of each email that each recipient in your contact list receives, by clicking on the "`BCC to me`" checkbox. This will send a copy of each email to your inbox.
