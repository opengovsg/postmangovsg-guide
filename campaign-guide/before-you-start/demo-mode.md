# Demo Mode

{% hint style="info" %}
Without setting up credentials, each user is entitled to:

**3 campaigns each for SMS**

**Up to 20 recipients for each campaign**
{% endhint %}

The purpose of the demo campaign is to help you become more familiar with the SMS channel without the prerequisite of setting up their own credentials.

Once you are familiar with the flow, you can follow our video guide for the step-by-step set up for Twilio for SMS sending or book a slot with the Postman team if you need additional help.
