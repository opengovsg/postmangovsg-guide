# Useful Twilio Links

1. **Where can I find more information on Twilio's direct invoicing billing method?**

Read [here](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025603913-Reading-your-Twilio-Invoice) for more on invoicing.

2. **Twilio asked me for my message SID. What is this?**

This message SID is not the same as the messaging service SID which you obtained during the set-up process. This is an identifier for the SMSes that you have sent out, which provides Twilio with more information about your message such as delivery status, message content, and relevant timings. It is a 34 character string that starts with “SM…” for text messages.&#x20;

You can read more about it and find it [here](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223134387-What-is-a-Message-SID-).
