# Onboarding - Step 2 (onboarding form)

Now, it is over to Postman. Fill in the WOG onboarding form [here](https://form.gov.sg/646b1a06df92fa001262a17e).

#### Why is this form necessary?

As part of the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes, Twilio is required to conduct checks on all approved senderIDs submitted by organisations, before they can proceed to tag your SMSes with the senderIDs after your campaign leaves the Postman gateway. To make things easier for public service agencies, OGP has negotiated an agreement with IMDA and Twilio to recognise all Postman SMS users as legitimate. This means that you will need to fill in our [form](https://form.gov.sg/646b1a06df92fa001262a17e) so we can provide the necessary validation details to Twilio, saving you the need to go through this process on your own - which is infinitely more tedious!

#### What information will I need to provide?

Once you have your senderID approved, you'll need these information on-hand to fill in our [form](https://form.gov.sg/646b1a06df92fa001262a17e):

1. Your demographic information - name, email address, agency, division, designation.
2. A 1-2 line write-up about your use case.
3. Your monthly SMS volume.
4. Expected go-live date.
5. Your registered senderID.
6. Proof of the senderID approval. **Please submit screenshots of your approved senderID, otherwise, we will not be able to process your form.** Sample screenshots below.
