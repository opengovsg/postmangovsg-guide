# What is PostmanSG

PostmanSG is a mass messaging tool for the Singapore Government.

We've since sent out more than 100 million messages from over 90 agencies. This includes quarantine orders, COVID-19 test results and employer notices.

Start using PostmanSG by logging in with an `@agency.gov.sg` email address!

## What can PostmanSG do?

* **Easily customize messages to reach a wide audience**: Create a message template, upload a file containing customization parameters, and we will handle the rest for you.
* **Mass send emails**: Just click `Send campaign` and PostmanSG will send those messages out to your intended audience via email.
* **Mass send SMSes**: Enter your Twilio credentials under `Settings`, and PostmanSG will send those messages via SMS. No integration with Twilio is needed.
* **Mass send Telegram messages through a bot**: Get your recipients to subscribe to your Telegram bot and use PostmanSG to send Telegram messages to the subscribers by uploading the subscriber's contact list.
* **View stats**: Keep track of your campaign's progress as it is sending and check back when it is completed.
* **Scheduled sending**: Create your campaign but send it out at a later **time**.

## Is PostmanSG secure?

Email and SMS are not 100% secure. We recommend against putting any sensitive information in the email or SMS content. To transmit sensitive content, some users generate a recipient-specific unique link to a locked page. We have completed our VAPT on June 15th, 2020.

## Can PostmanSG be accessed on the government intranet?

PostmanSG is only available on the internet at the moment.

## What data can PostmanSG handle?

We use cloud infrastructure so we can handle up to **Confidential (Cloud-Eligible)** data. When in doubt, you should follow IM8â€™s guidelines on data classification.

## Difference between the Web App and Programmatic APIs

**Web App:** Users can access PostmanSG by going to [https://postman.gov.sg](https://postman.gov.sg). The web app is a user interface that allows all users to send campaigns.

**Programmatic APIs**: In addition to campaigns, we also allow technical users to call our APIs to send messages programmatically. This typically requires a system integration involving your engineers or IT support. In order to use this feature, you need to generate an API key from `Settings` in the PostmanSG web app. You can find more by going to our API Guide [here](https://guide.postman.gov.sg/api-guide/overview).
