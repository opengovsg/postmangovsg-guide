# About PostmanSG

PostmanSG is a mass messaging tool for the Singapore Government. These messages can be sent via our web app directly (see [campaign guide](https://guide.postman.gov.sg/campaign-guide/before-you-start)) or via API integration (see [API guide](https://guide.postman.gov.sg/api-guide/overview)).

We've sent out more than 100 million messages from over 90 agencies. These include quarantine orders, COVID-19 test results, and employer notices.

Start using PostmanSG by logging in with your `@agency.gov.sg` email address!

## What can PostmanSG API do?

We provide a **modern, cost-effective, and compliant PaaS** for government agencies to send programmatic emails and messages. Head over to the [API guide](https://guide.postman.gov.sg/api-guide/overview) to find out more.

## Is PostmanSG secure?

Emails, SMSes and Telegram messages are not 100% secure. Users should be wary of putting sensitive information directly in your message body. Depending on the level of sensitivity, users can consider using recipient-specific, high-entropy links or requiring further authentication to see sensitive information.

## Can PostmanSG be accessed on the government intranet?

The PostmanSG web app can be accessed on GSIBs that allows Secure Internet Surfing.

## What data can PostmanSG handle?

We use cloud infrastructure so we can handle up to **Confidential (Cloud-Eligible)** data. When in doubt, you should follow IM8â€™s guidelines on data classification.

| Normal email/SMS/Telegram | Non-sensitive to sensitivity low-normal | <ul><li>Transaction</li><li>Notification</li><li>Information broadcast</li><li>Receipts</li><li>Reminders</li></ul> |

## Difference between the Web App and Programmatic APIs

**Web App:** Users can access PostmanSG by going to [https://postman.gov.sg](https://postman.gov.sg). The web app has a user interface that allows users to send templated messages via campaigns.

**Programmatic APIs**: Users who manage their own systems could also call our APIs to send messages programmatically. In order to use this feature, you need to generate an API key from `Settings` in the PostmanSG web app. You can find more by going to our API Guide [here](https://guide.postman.gov.sg/api-guide/overview).
