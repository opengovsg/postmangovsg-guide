# SMS Best Practices

1. SMSes sent early in the week (e.g. Monday) and day (especially waking hours from 8-10am) are more likely to be seen and read. This [article](https://simpletexting.com/the-best-times-to-schedule-a-text-message-campaign/) provides useful tips, and our own internal research has also shown this to be the case!
2. If recipients have reached out to you to unsubscribe from your SMS campaigns, respect their wishes to be removed from the list, unless your SMSes are of an urgent, or need-to-know nature.
3. Straightforward and direct content works most effectively, as they provide a sense of officiality.
4. If you must include links in your SMS, note that links should not point to log in pages. For better security, create your links on [GoGovSG](https://go.gov.sg/#/).&#x20;
