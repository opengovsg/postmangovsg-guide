# ðŸ“ž The official Gov.sg WhatsApp channel

Gov.SG Whatsapp is a channel the Singapore government has established to ensure secure communication between the Government and citizens. On Postman, as a government agency user, you can use this feature to send an official message ahead of time to let residents know about your upcoming call directly via the Gov.sg Whatsapp, so that they will know who you are and why you are calling.

Interested in using this channel? Indicate your interest [here](https://go.gov.sg/sgc-interest-form) and we will be in touch to onboard you after August 2023.

To read up more about onboarding to and using the Gov.sg WhatsApp channel on Postman, log in to the Singapore Government Developer Portal [here](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/postman-sgdp-guide/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Postman is the platform through which agencies can use the Gov.sg WhatsApp channel to send messages that verify the identity of Government officers.&#x20;

Postman currently does not yet have WhatsApp as a channel for general broadcast communications, beyond this specific template that allows officers to send a notification ahead of a call.&#x20;
